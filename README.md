# Braze_API_automation
#This project is all about getting the required responses from the API calls which will help you in testing GluMarketing SDK. In simple words, we can say it play's the role of braze dashboard.  
#
#In RevSDK project, we do use Braze Dashboard for verifying whether the inputs given in GluMarketing SDK is reflected correctly or not.  
#
#Currently, in this project i am using only one API call which gives almost all the information which we look for in the braze dashboard.
