# Braze_API_automation
This project is all about getting the required responses from the API calls which will help you in testing GluMarketing SDK. In simple words, we can say it play's the role of braze dashboard.  <br />

In RevSDK project, we do use Braze Dashboard for verifying whether the inputs given in GluMarketing SDK is reflected correctly or not.<br />  

Currently, in this project i am using only one API call which gives almost all the information which we look for in the braze dashboard. <br />

Installation steps: <br />
Install python (latest version) on your PC (https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br />
Install any IDE (my suggestion will be visual studio) (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)<br />
Now install required python libraries via cmd using the command pip install <required library name><br />
ex: pip install requests<br />
      pip install json<br />
      pip install html-testRunner<br />
Now download the below zip file & unzip it.<br />
Now open this folder via Visual Studio code. <br />
Save all the files. Now go to testrunner.py file & click on run.<br />
Once the execution got completed successfully (as show above, where you need to see the cursor blinking again), you will get a report in the output folder which is inside the below project folder.(Ex: C:\Users\daraksha.iram\Desktop\BrazeAPI_Automation\output)<br />
Check the response their by clicking on the view button beside the pass label & perform your checks. Below is the screenshot of the report.
